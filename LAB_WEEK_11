1. When a user takes a picture, the code that stores the picture using the given URI
   is handled inside ProviderFileManager.insertToStore(). This is the part of the
   code that actually copies the captured file into MediaStore.

   (Copied from the project)

   private fun insertToStore(fileInfo: FileInfo, contentUri: Uri,
                              contentValues: ContentValues) {
       executor.execute {
           val insertedUri = contentResolver.insert(contentUri, contentValues)
           insertedUri?.let {
               val inputStream = contentResolver.openInputStream(fileInfo.uri)
               val outputStream = contentResolver.openOutputStream(insertedUri)
               IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream)
           }
       }
   }

   This is the function that:
   - receives the URI pointing to the temporary file from FileProvider
   - opens an InputStream from that URI
   - creates a new file entry inside MediaStore
   - copies the bytes into MediaStore’s final location


2. FileInfo.kt contains 5 attributes:
   uri, file, name, relativePath, mimeType

   • First attribute — uri:
     This URI refers to the "content://" URI generated by FileProvider.
     It is a temporary access URI that the camera app uses to write the image
     into our app's private external storage.

   • Fourth attribute — relativePath:
     This refers to the folder path inside MediaStore where the file should be
     placed, such as "Pictures/" or "Movies/".
     On Android 10 (API 29) and above, MediaStore saves the file into this
     directory under External Storage (e.g., DCIM/ or Pictures/).


3. Bonus — Chronological order of taking a picture until it is stored in MediaStore:

   1. User presses the "Photo" button → openImageCapture() is called.
   2. ProviderFileManager.generatePhotoUri() creates:
      - a File in "Android/data/<package>/files/Pictures"
      - a FileProvider URI pointing to that file.
   3. takePictureLauncher.launch(uri) opens the Camera app and tells it
      "write the captured image into this URI".
   4. After capturing the photo, TakePicture() returns success → 
      providerFileManager.insertImageToStore(photoInfo) is executed.
   5. insertToStore():
      - Creates a new entry in MediaStore using ContentValues.
      - Opens an InputStream from the temporary FileProvider URI.
      - Opens an OutputStream to the MediaStore URI.
      - Copies the file bytes into the final MediaStore location.
   6. The final image is now accessible from the Gallery and other apps.
